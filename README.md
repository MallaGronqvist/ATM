### ATM Interface

## About the project

This is a terminal application that simulates an ATM interface. 
To be able to use the application the bank customer needs to sign up for a bank account.
After signing up the bank customer can sign in to their account, and deposit and withdraw money,
or transfer money from their own account to another account. The customer can also view the account balance
and change customer credentials.

## Java SDK version

17.0.2 (build 17.0.2 + 8)

## How to run

The program is designed for a real terminal where the screen can be cleared when navigating to different parts of the
app. If you run the program in an IDE console, it won't display correctly.
Hence, to run the program, you can create a jar file and with all the source files and run it from your terminal with
the java -jar ATM.jar command. Or you can compile the source files from your terminal with the command javac Main.java
and run it with java ATM. java command.

## Project Management

While creating this project I have practiced the agile work process. 
I have gathered requirements in a document called 'Functional requirements' that can be found in the 'Project Management' directory.
I have also created user stories with their acceptance criteria and tasks in an Excel document. 
This list can be found in the document 'Product backlog.pdf' in the 'Project Management' directory.
The 'Design Document' in the same directory introduces the UI and the program flow.

I have also made a UML use case diagram, UML sequence diagrams and UML class diagrams. 
These can be found in the subdirectory called 'Diagrams' in the 'Project Management' directory.
